## Ebay Notifier

PLAN: Separate Concerns
--> Create class that takes search terms and finds ebay listings main page, scrapes this and returns array of URLs of individual listings
--> Have command line interface that prompts user for search terms, Email address, 2 step verification code and destination address for notifications to be sent to
